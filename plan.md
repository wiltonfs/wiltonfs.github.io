# Home Page
At the top of the page is my name FELIX WILTON
Below it, in lighter and smaller font is my email.
Clicking on my name takes you back to the home page
https://wiltonfs.github.io

Next is 4 horizontally arranged text buttons:
ABOUT, PORTFOLIO, RESUME, MORE PROJECTS. Each goes to another page on this domain, namely:
https://wiltonfs.github.io/about
https://wiltonfs.github.io
https://wiltonfs.github.io/resume
https://wiltonfs.github.io/more

On the Left there is a 3:4 headshot of me. On the Right there is a brief bio.

Below this there are three square photos. Each photo is a button. Below each photo is a outlined box with a label inside. The box is a button with the same link as the photo it is under. The three labels are:
AstroAI, Ondaadad, Gone Fishing. Each goes to another page on this domain, namely:
https://wiltonfs.github.io/AstroAI
https://wiltonfs.github.io/Ondaadad
https://wiltonfs.github.io/GoneFishing

At the bottom center of the page there are two small buttons, arranged horizontally. One has the LinkedIn logo on it and takes you to my LinkedIn page. The other has a small GitHub logo on it and takes you to my github.
