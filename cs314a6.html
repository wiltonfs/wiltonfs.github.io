            Welcome to this blog post where I'll be sharing my experiences and insights from CPSC 314's Assignment 6. This course has been a fascinating journey into modeling, rendering, and basic animation. For assignment 6, I was tasked with exploring the capabilities and limitations of a generative AI tool.

            I opted for Microsoft Image Creator with the goal of crafting concept art for video games. Currently, I am working on an educational, historical video game project for the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in southern Ontario. I used the model to generate concept art for the game I am working on. The final image was a fusion of my initial prompt and subsequent iterations, gradually refining the visual elements. Using words like “concept art” helped make the style closer to what I had in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            The creative process involved writing a prompt to describe my vision, generating an initial image, and then iteratively refining it. I found that the tool responded well to prompt modifications, allowing me to guide the evolution of the image. However, making nuanced changes, especially when focusing on specific elements like foreground or background adjustments, proved challenging without a layering feature. It was next to impossible to change only one part of the image. Adding a single adjective to the prompt would require a full regeneration.
        </p>

        <p>
            The standout feature was the tool's adeptness at incorporating text into the generated images. Unlike other generative AI experiences I have seen on social media, Microsoft Image Creator performed well in integrating text, even if some outputs were nonsensical. Also, I was impressed how well the very first image turned out, even with a pretty sparse prompt. In the end, I asked it to remove text for the final image. However, I was impressed that I would be able to use the tool to mock up a GUI or UI concept art as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was difficult to make small changes to the image. For example, if I liked the foreground but just wanted to slightly tweak the background, a small change to the prompt would create a completely new image where the foreground has also changed. Some sort of layer feature would maybe be nice; where I could lock features or layers and focus on one element. I think it would be even more powerful when integrated with something like Photoshop, mixing the generative power with the creative tools built into the existing software.
        </p>

        <p>
            I foresee this being used for concept art for video games. I am interested in the video game industry and like we learned from our first guest speaker, Ryan Schmidt, 3D assets that are game-ready do not come out of these generative algorithms. However, for concept art to inspire a dev team or to serve as inspiration art, something generative like this would be very very useful. I can also see value with this as a solo dev that doesn’t have a lot of art experience. You could generate placeholder 2D art and then progress through development, and at the end pay an artist to replace it and they would already have a good idea of what things should look like and how the pieces fit together. Also, the text generation gave me ideas for prototyping GUI/UI, menus, and other layers that sit over the game and display information to the player. Generating concept art and pleasing UIs are not something I have a lot of practice in. Using a program like this would give me a way to do more development and less time trying to figure out an art tool.

            In this last assignment, I had the opportunity to explore exciting concepts that challenged my understanding of standard computer science workflows.
