Utilized a large astronomy dataset and HPC clusters to accelerate and scale the data processing. Collaborated closely with a team of experts, presenting progress updates and proposing new ideas. Contributed to a cutting-edge software pipeline for spectra-to-stellar parameters in astrophysics, achieving a more complete map of chemical evolution in the Milky Way galaxy.",
